# latticulator

Physics of Solid State is a very important branch of physics. This branch lets people use quantum physics to manipulate properties of materials in the world. One of important knowledge should be known by material engineers is material's lattice parameter. This knwoledge can help material engineers to figure out what to do and what can be done to a material. <br>

In conclusion, my team has conduct a research to provide an alternative tool to count lattice parameter easier and more efficient. Theoretical background and algorithm of the program are published in [here](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/2019/1/012070). <br>

As a comparison, you can refer to XRD data below. <br>

You can run the app, type 1 to choose CUBIC crystal structure, type 7 as total rows of XRD data, and type in XRD data per row. It should produce lattice parameter as a in very similar number with what is written in XRD data.
