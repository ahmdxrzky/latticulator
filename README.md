# Latticulator

Physics of Solid State is a very important branch of physics. This branch lets people use quantum physics to manipulate properties of materials in the world. One of important knowledge should be known by material engineers is material's lattice parameter. This knwoledge can help material engineers to figure out what to do and what can be done to a material. <br>

In conclusion, my team has conduct a research to provide an app as an alternative tool to count lattice parameter easier and more efficient. This app called Latticulator. The Theoretical background and algorithm of the program are published in [here](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/2019/1/012070). <br>

This repo contains an executable file in windows in .exe format. That file was built as a Python script file that being converted to exe file using Pyinstaller module. You can just download that exe file and run it in your windows machine.

As a comparison, you can refer to XRD data below. You can use 1 to choose Cubic crystal structure and input this rows from XRD data one by one. The app will provide the lattice parameter of the crystal structure.<br>
